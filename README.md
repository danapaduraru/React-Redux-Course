# React-Redux-Course
Code I wrote following a tutorial for learning Redux and React.

### Course Notes


- state becomes only one for the entire application
- it is immutable, it comes from the top down
- you don't change it, it's recreated

![Redux Workflow Diagram](https://i.ibb.co/CtgGYnF/Screenshot-6.png)

- View = your react components
- Store = your state, sends your state down to your components
- dispatch = send off to a destination with a purpose
- Reducers = pure functions that specify how the application state should change in respond to the actions. The reducers respond with that new state.
